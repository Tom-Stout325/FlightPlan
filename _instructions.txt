Next Steps:

Add link to transactions and invoice in the Job Review

Airspace:
See if Waiver Planning is better than Waiver Rediness, get rid of one of them


Fix Rediness form so it looks better
Create CRUD for Rediness
Create PDF output for Rediness

Rediness form:
    Add Aircraft from Equipment into the Dropdown

Populate Pilot Info
    name    
    Flight hours
    certificate number

Add Timezone dropdown fields

Remove:  Purpose operations details

Fix Nearest Airport dropdown - it's not auto-flightlog

OOP Waiver Document
    Link OOP Waiver number

OOMV Waiver 
    Link waiver doc

Remove ATC frequency

One more heads-up (related to your earlier Airspace admin autocomplete issue)
If your Airspace WaiverPlanningAdmin.autocomplete_fields includes:
nearest_airport_ref (Airport)
aircraft (Equipment)
pilot_profile (PilotProfile)
oop_waiver_document / mv_waiver_document (GeneralDocument)
…then those referenced models must have:
an admin registered (for Airport, etc.)
search_fields defined on that admin
✅ This GeneralDocumentAdmin now has search_fields, so it will satisfy autocomplete if you add oop_waiver_document / mv_waiver_document to autocomplete_fields.
If you paste your current airspace/admin.py autocomplete_fields line (or tell me what you want to autocomplete), I’ll give you the exact minimal set of ModelAdmins you need to register (AirportAdmin, EquipmentAdmin, PilotProfileAdmin) with the right search_fields so the system checks are clean.
